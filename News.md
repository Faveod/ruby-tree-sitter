1. Added `kwarg` `all` to `Node#fetch` which defaults to `false`.
   If `true`, return an array of nodes for all the demanded keys, putting `nil`
   for missing ones.
   If `false`, return the same array after calling `compact`.
1. `fetch_all` as an alias to `fetch(â€¦, all: true)`

## v0.20.8.2

1. When you use `--disable-sys-lib` this extension will:
  1. download `tree-sitter` via `git`, `curl`, or `wget`.
  1. statically link against downloaded `tree-sitter` . 
1. The native gems are also statically linked.

With static linking, any installed version of `tree-sitter` will not be loaded.

All other methods will dynamically link against the installed `tree-sitter`.
