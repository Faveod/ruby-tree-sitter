# Ruby tree-sitter bindings

[![ci](https://github.com/Faveod/ruby-tree-sitter/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Faveod/ruby-tree-sitter/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![valgrind](https://github.com/Faveod/ruby-tree-sitter/actions/workflows/valgrind.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Faveod/ruby-tree-sitter/actions/workflows/valgrind.yml) [![asan/ubsan](https://github.com/Faveod/ruby-tree-sitter/actions/workflows/asan.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Faveod/ruby-tree-sitter/actions/workflows/asan.yml) 

Ruby bindings for [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter).

The [official bindings](https://github.com/tree-sitter/ruby-tree-sitter) are
very old, unmaintained, and don't work with modern `tree-sitter` APIs.


## Usage

``` ruby
require 'tree_sitter'

parser = TreeSitter::Parser.new
language = TreeSitter.load('javascript', 'path/to/libtree-sitter-javascript.{so,dylib}')

src = "[1, null]"

parser.language = language

tree = parser.parse_string(nil, src)
root = tree.root_node

root.each do |child|
  # ...
end
```

## About

The main philosophy behind these bindings is to do a 1:1 mapping between
tree-sitter's `C` API and `Ruby`.

It doesn't mean that we're going to yield the best perormance, but this design
allows us to better experiment, and easily port ideas from other projects.

### Versioning

This gem follows the `tree-sitter` versioning scheme, and appends its own
version at the end.

For instance, `tree-sitter` is now at version `0.20.6`, so this gem's version
will be `0.20.6.x` where x is incremented with every notable batch of
bugfixes or some ruby-only additions.

## Dependencies

This gem is a binding for `tree-sitter`.  It doesn't have a version of
`tree-sitter` baked in it.

You must install `tree-sitter` and make sure that their dynamic library is
accessible from `$PATH`, or build the gem with `--disable-sys-libs`, which will
download the latest tagged `tree-sitter` and build against it (see [Build from
source](docs/Development.md#build-from-source) .)

You can either install `tree-sitter` from source or through your go-to package manager.

### Linux

`ubuntu >= 22.04`

```console
sudo apt install libtree-sitter-dev
```

`arch`

```console
sudo pacman -S tree-sitter
```

### MacOS

```console
sudo port install tree-sitter
```

or

```console
brew install tree-sitter
```

## Install

We haven't released the gem on `Rubygems` as of yet, but we'e planning on doing so.

Meanwhile, please install from `git` source, which will compile on installation.

If you don't want to install from `git`, or if you don't want to compile on
install, download a native gem from this repository's
[releases](https://github.com/Faveod/ruby-tree-sitter/releases), or you can
compile it yourself (see [Build from
source](docs/Development.md#build-from-source) .)

### Gemfile

```ruby
gem 'tree_sitter', git: 'https://github.com/Faveod/ruby-tree-sitter'
```

If you chose to install a native gem, then you'd have to download it somewhere
and then specify `path` as such:

``` ruby
gem 'tree_sitter', path: 'path/to/native/tree_sitter.gem'
```

### Parsers

You will have to install parsers yourself, either by:

1. Downloading and building from source.
1. Downloading from your package manager, if available.
1. Downloading a pre-built binary from
   [Faveod/tree-sitter-parsers](https://github.com/Faveod/tree-sitter-parsers)
   which supports numerous architectures.

## Examples

See `examples` directory.

## Development

See [`docs/README.md`](docs/Development.md).

## üöß üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Notes üë∑ üöß

Since we're doing a 1:1 mapping between the `tree-sitter` API and the bindings,
you need to be extra-careful when playing with the provided objects.  Some of
them have their underlying `C` data-structure automatically freed, so you might
get yourself in undesirable situations if you don't pay attention to what you're
doing.

We're only talking about `Tree`, `TreeCursor`, `Query`, and `QueryCursor`.  Just
don't copy them left and right, and then expect them to work without
`SEGFAULT`ing and creating a black-hole in your living-room.  Assume that you
have to work locally with them. If you get a `SEGFAULT`, you can debug the
native `C` code using `gdb`.  You can read more on `SEGFAULT`s
[here](docs/SIGSEGV.md), and debugging [here](docs/Development.md#Debugging).

That said, we do aim at providing an idiomatic `Ruby` interface.  It should also
provide a _safer_ interface, where you don't have to worry about when and how
resources are freed.
