      # FIXME: I faced a lot of issues with gemstash while running the project
      # with gemstash and bundler. It refuses to correctly recognize the ruby
      # version. For instance, with ruby-version 3.3 I get this:
      #
      #     Because every version of ruby_tree_sitter depends on Ruby >= 3.4, < 3.5.dev
      #       and Gemfile depends on ruby_tree_sitter = 1.11.0,
      #       Ruby >= 3.4, < 3.5.dev is required.
      #
      # Yes, I am running on a ruby 3.3 and getting complaints on ruby 3.4.
      # But even before the release of 3.4, I got:
      #
      #       Ruby >= 3.3, < 3.4.dev is required.
      #
      # So I decided to turn it off and maybe get back to it later.
      # I looked at issues of bundler, nokogiri, gemstash, and rake-compiler-doc,
      # and I couldn't find anyone complaining about this issue.
